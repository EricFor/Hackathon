### Welcome to our Submission for the Somona Hackathon, 2022

### Inspiration, thougt process and what we learnt:

Our project is a website made with React and Express. Our idea for this site was something can be used to help promote healthier lifestyles. So we came up with a goal setting app that motivates you to complete tasks set by the yourself. We were inspired by our fellow peers at our High school where the mental wellness of the student body is very low. So the audience we planned to target was students as we know how much being organized can help lower the stress someone has.

# Challenges and What we learned:

    A huge challenge for most of us was getting used to React and Javascript. In our team of 3, there was only one person with prior experience. The other members had less than a week experience of in both Javascript and React. There was also the fact that all of our members were uncomfortable with CSS. Styling our site was the biggest time consumer overall. The time constraint really put us in a bind and we had to cut some of the features and styling choices we initially wanted. However, we believe this really took our coding knowledge and challenged it. We grew so much from this short project and learned more about back-end, styling, React, and Javascript.

# Setup Directions:

## Prerequisites: 
1. Node.js

1. Clone the git repository

### Frontend:

2. Go into the frontend directory (`cd frontend`)
3. Run `npm install` to install all necessary modules
4. Run `npm run build` to build the project
5. Run `npm run serve` to start the server

### Backend:

2. Go into the backend directory (`cd server`)
3. Run `npm install` to install all necessary modules
4. Run `npm run build` to build the project
5. Run `node .` to run the server

# Directions:

1. As soon as you bootup the site you should sign-up
2. After doing that you will be prompted to a login field where you will login
3. After that you can then go back to the lifestyles page where you can create a new goal

# How we can improve:

As this hackathon was only a day, we were not able to introduce some of the features we wanted to. These include a motivation system and a better user experience. We hope to improve the user experience, add a motivation system and tidy up our code after this hackathon.
